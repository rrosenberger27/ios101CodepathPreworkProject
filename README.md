## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Letterboxd :
- rate and write reviews for movies
- create lists
- see other users' reviews, ratings and lists

TikTok:
- follow other users
- scroll through different videos
- send videos to other users

Instagram:
- follow other users
- post videos and images
- send videos and images to other users

Snapchat: 
- automatically deletes old messages
- send videos, photos, and chats to friends

APP IDEA:
An app idea that I have is an app that like Letterboxd, but for TV shows instead of movies.
This app would be user focused and would allow users to do things like follow other users, post reviews and ratings
for episodes, seasons, and series, like and comment on other users' reviews and ratings, create lists, and search for TV shows 
based on various categories.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Most things went smoothly while I worked through but one challenge I encountered
was with my app running at first. Whenever I tried to run the simulator the first time,
the build would fail. I ultimately decided to try to see what information I could find on the 
error that was happening and then went back through the initial steps with an increased attention to detail
to get my project to run.
